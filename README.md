# MPFS Discovery Kit Video Pipeline

I wanted to use the camera on Microchip's MPFS Discovery-Kit[^myfn][^1], but there was no
real example on the internet. So I started to rebuild stuff from the 
Video-Kit-Reference-Design[^2]. I am still far from being done, but at least the
project can be rebuilt.

I did get an image though:
